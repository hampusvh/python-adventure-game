# üó∫Ô∏è Text-Based Adventure Game

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue?logo=python)

## About the Project

This repository contains a text-based adventure game developed in **Python 3** as part of the *Programming 1* course.  

The game features a main menu, branching story paths, and encounters with creatures where player choices determine the outcome. Certain decisions can end the game, while others trigger a dice-based mechanic that introduces random chance.  

The adventure is intentionally replayable, offering multiple loops and scenarios rather than a single fixed ending.


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hampusvh/python-adventure-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd python-adventure-game
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement multiple endings and extended story paths  
- [ ] Introduce additional creature types and randomized events  
- [ ] Enhance branching logic to expand the consequences of player choices
