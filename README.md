# 🗺️ Text-Based Adventure Game

## 📖 About the Project

This project was created as part of the course Programming 1, where I developed a simple text-based adventure game in Python.

The game starts with a main menu where the player can choose to begin their adventure. As the story unfolds, the player faces various choices that influence the outcome and lead to different scenarios.

Throughout the game, players may encounter different creatures and choose whether to fight them. In certain situations, making the wrong decision can result in the player's death and the end of the game. There is also a dice mechanic where random chance determines whether the player can proceed or not.

The adventure does not have a fixed ending and offers a limited number of choices. In the end, the game's loop returns to different functions, allowing the player to replay parts of the game multiple times.

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

- Download or clone the repository.

- Open the project in your code editor or terminal.

- Run the main file:

     ```bash
   python main.py


## ⚙️ Future Improvements

- Add multiple endings and more story paths

- Introduce more types of creatures and events

- Expand the consequences of player choices
